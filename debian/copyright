 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("CCPL" OR "LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORISED UNDER THIS LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. BY EXERCISING
 ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
 THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 This Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence enables You (all capitalised
 terms defined below) to view, edit, modify, translate and distribute Works
 worldwide, under the terms of this licence, provided that You credit the
 Original Author.
 .
 "The Licensor" and "You" agree as follows:
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 "Adaptation" means any work created by the editing, modification, adaptation
 or translation of the Work in any media (however a work that constitutes a
 Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
 Licence). For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition
 or sound recording, the synchronisation of the Work in timed-relation with a
 moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
 this Licence.
 .
 "Applicable Licence" means one of the licences described in clause 2.3(a), (b)
 or (c).
 .
 "Attribution" means acknowledging all the parties who have contributed to and
 have rights in the Work or Collection under this Licence; and "Attribute" has
 a corresponding meaning.
 .
 "Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with one
 or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a collective
 whole.
 .
 "Creative Commons Compatible Licence" means a license that is listed at
 https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
 Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this Licence, including,
 at a minimum, because that licence: (i) contains terms that have the same
 purpose, meaning and effect as the Licence Elements of this Licence; and,
 (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available
 under that licence under this Licence or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
 license with the same Licence Elements as this Licence.
 .
 "Licence" means this Creative Commons New Zealand Public Licence agreement.
 .
 "Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes indicated
 in the title of this Licence: Attribution, Share-Alike.
 .
 "Licensor" means one or more legally recognised persons or entities offering
 the Work under the terms and conditions of this Licence.
 .
 "Original Author" means the individual(s) or entity/ies who created the Work.
 .
 "Work" means the work protected by copyright which is offered under the terms
 of this Licence.
 .
 "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence who
 has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to the
 Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
 rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
 .
 For the purpose of this Licence, when not inconsistent with the context, words
 in the singular number include the plural number.
 .
 2. Licence Terms
 2.1 Subject to the terms of this agreement the Licensor hereby grants to You a
 worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, Licence for use and for the duration
 of copyright in the Work. You may:
 .
 copy the Work;
 .
 create one or more Adaptations. You must take reasonable steps to ensure any
 Adaptation clearly identifies that changes were made to the original Work;
 .
 incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
 .
 copy Adaptations or the Work as incorporated in any Collection; and
 .
 publish, distribute, archive, perform or otherwise disseminate the Work, the
 Adaptation or the Work as incorporated in any Collection, to the public.
 .
 All these rights may be exercised in any material form in any media whether
 now known or hereafter created. All these rights also include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats.
 .
 HOWEVER,
 You must not:
 .
 impose any terms on the use to be made of the Work, the Adaptation or the Work
 as incorporated in a Collection that alter or restrict the terms of this
 Licence or the Applicable Licence, as applicable, or any rights granted under
 it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability to exercise those
 rights;
 .
 impose any digital rights management technology on the Work, the Adaptation or
 the Work as incorporated in a Collection that alters or restricts the terms of
 this Licence or any rights granted under it or has the effect or intent of
 restricting the ability to exercise those rights;
 .
 sublicense the Work;
 .
 falsely Attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author;
 .
 subject the Work to any derogatory treatment as defined in the Copyright Act
 1994 provided that if the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor will
 not enforce this sub-clause to the extent necessary to enable You to
 reasonably exercise Your right under clause 2.1 to make Adaptations but not
 otherwise.
 .
 FINALLY,
 You must:
 .
 make reference to this Licence or the Applicable Licence, as applicable, (by
 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), spoken word or as appropriate to the media
 used) on all copies of the Work, Adaptations and Collections published,
 distributed, performed or otherwise disseminated or made available to the
 public by You;
 .
 recognise the Licensor’s / Original Author’s right of Attribution (right to be
 identified) in any Work, Adaptation and Collection that You publish,
 distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate to the public and ensure that You
 credit the Licensor / Original Author as appropriate to the media used. You
 will however remove such a credit if requested by the Licensor/Original Author;
 .
 not assert or imply any connection with sponsorship or endorsement by the
 Original Author or Licensor of You or Your use of the Work, without the
 separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author or Licensor;
 and to the extent reasonably practicable, keep intact all notices that refer
 to this Licence, in particular the URI, if any, that the Licensor specifies to
 be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
 notice or licensing information for the Work.
 .
 Additional Provisions
 2.2. Further licence from the Licensor
 Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
    the Work; or
    any Adaptation; or
    the Work as incorporated in a Collection
 .
 the Licensor agrees to offer to the relevant third party making use of the
 Work ("User") (in any of the alternatives set out above) a licence to use the
 Work on the same terms and conditions as granted to You hereunder.
 .
 2.3. Further licence from You
 Each time You publish, distribute, perform or otherwise disseminate
    an Adaptation; or
    an Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection
 .
 You agree to offer to the User (in either of the alternatives set out above) a
 licence to use the Adaptation on any of the following premises and to comply
 with such licence:
 .
    a licence to the Adaptation on the same terms and conditions as the licence
    granted to You hereunder; or
 .
    a later version of the licence granted to You hereunder with the same
    Licence Elements; or
 .
    any other Creative Commons licence (whether the Unported or a jurisdiction
    licence) with the same Licence Elements.
 .
    a Creative Commons Compatible Licence.
 .
 2.4. This Licence does not affect any rights that the User may have under any
 applicable law, including fair use, fair dealing or any other legally
 recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement.
 .
 2.5. All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 2.6. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually
 or via a licensing body such as a collecting society, for any exercise by You
 of the rights granted under this Licence.
 .
 2.7. If the Licensor is the Original Author the Licensor waives its moral
 right to object to derogatory treatments of the Work to the extent necessary
 to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under this Licence to make
 Adaptations but not otherwise. If the Licensor is not the Original Author the
 Work will still be subject to the moral rights of the Original Author.
 .
 3. Warranties and Disclaimer
 Except as required by law or as otherwise agreed in writing between the
 parties, the Work is licensed by the Licensor on an "as is" and "as available"
 basis and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
 .
 4. Limit of Liability
 Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law the
 Licensor shall not be liable on any legal basis (including without limitation
 negligence) and hereby expressly excludes all liability for loss or damage
 howsoever and whenever caused to You.
 .
 5. Termination
 The rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically
 upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or entities
 who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this Licence,
 however, will not have their Licences terminated provided such individuals or
 entities remain in full compliance with those Licences. Clauses 1, 3, 4, 5 and
 6 will survive any termination of this Licence.
 .
 6. General
 6.1. The validity or enforceability of the remaining terms of this agreement
 is not affected by the holding of any provision of it to be invalid or
 unenforceable.
 .
 6.2. This Licence constitutes the entire Licence Agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The
 Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in
 any communication in any form.
 .
 6.3. A person who is not a party to this Licence shall have no rights under
 the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 to enforce any of its terms.
 .
 7. On the role of Creative Commons
 7.1. Creative Commons does not authorise either the Licensor or the User to
 use the trade mark “Creative Commons” or any related trade mark, including the
 Creative Commons logo, except to indicate that the Work is licensed under a
 Creative Commons Licence. Any permitted use has to be in compliance with the
 Creative Commons trade mark usage guidelines at the time of use of the
 Creative Commons trade mark. These guidelines may be found on the Creative
 Commons website or be otherwise available upon request from time to time. For
 the avoidance of doubt this trade mark restriction does not form part of this
 Licence.
 .
 7.2. Creative Commons Corporation does not profit financially from its role in
 providing this Licence and will not investigate the claims of any Licensor or
 user of the Licence.
 .
 7.3. One of the conditions that Creative Commons Corporation requires of the
 Licensor and You is an acknowledgement of its limited role and agreement by
 all who use the Licence that the Corporation is not responsible to anyone for
 the statements and actions of You or the Licensor or anyone else attempting to
 use or using this Licence.
 .
 7.4. Creative Commons Corporation is not a party to this Licence, and makes no
 warranty whatsoever in connection to the Work or in connection to the Licence,
 and in all events is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the
 Licensor's or Your reliance on this Licence or on its enforceability.
 .
 7.5. USE OF THIS LICENCE MEANS THAT YOU AND THE LICENSOR EACH ACCEPTS THESE
 CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 AND EACH ACKNOWLEDGES CREATIVE
 COMMONS CORPORATION'S VERY LIMITED ROLE AS A FACILITATOR OF THE LICENCE FROM
 THE LICENSOR TO YOU.

 LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04
 .
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the
 LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
 .
 You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and
 which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if
 your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written in such
 a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX.
 .
 The section 'WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below,
 gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
 considering distributing their works under this license.
 .
 This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and
 modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may
 be distributed.
 .
 We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom
 to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with
 whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability,
 integrity, and reliability of that work.  If you do not see how to achieve
 your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document
 'cfgguide.tex' and 'modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for
 suggestions.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 In this license document the following terms are used:
 .
   'Work'
    Any work being distributed under this License.
 .
   'Derived Work'
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.
 .
   'Modification' 
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.
 .
   'Modify'
    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
    applicable law.
 .
   'Distribution'
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
 .
   'Compiled Work'
    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
 .
   'Current Maintainer'
    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
    any applicable law.
 .
   'Base Interpreter' 
    A program or process that is normally needed for running or
    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    
 .
    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
    'LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the 
    'LaTeX-format' a program implementing the 'TeX language'.
 .
 CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not
 covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of
 running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any
 offers of support for the Work.
 .
 2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received
 it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the
 Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the
 terms of this clause.
 .
 3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
 complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as
 long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients
 may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been
 installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.
 .
 4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
 restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may also
 distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works
 generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works distributed in this manner by
 the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.
 .
 5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your
 copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile
 this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.
 .
 6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
 Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of
 the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it
 is exempt from that condition.  Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add
 such statements of exemption to a component of the Work. 
 .
  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
     of this component to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter.
 .     
  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
     of the changes.
 .
  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
 .
  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
 .
       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; 
          if your distribution of a modified component is made by
          offering access to copy the modified component from a
          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
          copy the Work along with the modified component;
 .
       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
          unmodified copy of the Work.
 .
 7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a
 Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is
 distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the
 conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.
 .
 8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply
 to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes
 identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is
 distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
 .
 9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format,
 where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by
 applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections
 of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.
 .
 10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
        provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
        Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
        to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
 .
     b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
        Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
        itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the 
        restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
 .
 11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the
 Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works
 with the Work by any means.
 .
 12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
 complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in writing,
 the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind,
 either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
 warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.  The
 entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you.  Should
 the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
 repair, or correction.
 .
 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The
 Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any
 other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be
 liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
 consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability
 to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being
 rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure
 of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder
 or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such
 damages.
 .
 MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
 .
 The Work has the status 'author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly
 and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the
 Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is
 'author-maintained'.
 .
 The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has
 indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the
 Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required
 for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.
 .
 The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no
 Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work
 cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of
 six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.
 .
 You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any
 existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
 .
 If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work
 through the following steps:
 .
 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
     an Internet or similar search.
 .
 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
     is still maintained.
 .
  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
     to update their communication data within one month.
 .
  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
     within the pertinent community your intention to take over
     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)
 .
 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
     immediately upon announcement.
 .
  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  
 .
 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
 .
 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
     reachable once more within three months of a change completed
     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
     they then update their communication data within one month.
 .
 A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that
 the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
 .
 If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately
 provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status
 as Current Maintainer.  You should also announce your new status to the same
 pertinent community as in 2b) above.
